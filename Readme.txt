Code for final project by Chuang Zhou and Jin Cui

current python version 3.8

To get the same result, you need to run final-kmeans.ipynb,final-LES.ipynb,final_Decision_Tree.ipynb in right environment. 
Please make sure that all the CSV files are in the same floder with ipynb files, or you cannot import the data.
If you want to draw the decision tree.png, you should install graphviz firstly, or you can just get the tree in dictionary format 

mask.csv  --- original data file, make sure it is on the same path as final.py
final.py   ---- anaconda Spyder
final-kmeans.ipynb  --- anaconda jupyter
final-LES.ipynb  --- anaconda jupyter
final_Decision_Tree.ipynb  --- anaconda jupyter
analysis.txt 
infection rate kmeans.txt 
infection rate LES.txt  ---intermediate result, not important
DT.png --- the pic of decision tree's result
